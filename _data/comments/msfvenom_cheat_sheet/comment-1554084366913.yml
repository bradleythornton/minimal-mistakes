message: "Leinster vs Ulster (21-18) | Heineken Champions Cup Highlights\r\n \r\nUlster is not really a proper Irish team( their supporters originally came from Scotland before they brought their bigotry to Ireland ) glad they were sent back up the North with their tails between their legs . Stockdale was always too cocky and got his comeuppance . \nhttps://ie.vlip.lv/video/p75qb0t9oCCoMoM%3D.html"
