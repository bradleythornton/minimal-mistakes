message: "Protect Against Bank Lending and Closure\r\n\r\nBy keeping your funds in a traditional bank, you are giving that institution the opportunity to lend your personal funds out to others. This means that you do not receive any interest or increase of value in your wealth, while the bank makes money off the high interest rates they charge on loaning your money out. \r\n\r\nWith the banks only keeping 10% of their holdings in liquid funds, your money becomes nothing more than a number and an account. The Amen System brings the control of currency back to you, as you are able to store your funds in your wallet. This means that you have 24/7 access to your funds to purchase goods, transfer to others, lend others, convert to fiat currency and more.\r\n\r\nIn case of a sudden recession in your country, you are protected from banks closing, offering limited withdrawals or simply not having your funds accessible. The Amen Mobile Wallet means you have complete control over your money, at all times.\r\n\r\nhttp://amendollar.io - Read More"
