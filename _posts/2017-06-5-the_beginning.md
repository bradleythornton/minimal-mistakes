I’ve thought about making my own blog for several years now and I finally took the leap! I figured this would serve as a good place to put my thoughts into words and to host some helpful resources for anyone interested in information security. I hope to keep this updated and provide content that others find useful as well, so drop me a line if you’d like anything added.  
  
Just as a side-note, I’m hosting this site through github pages and it is really freaking cool. If you are looking for an inexpensive and low-maintenance way to host a quick site (whether full-fledged or just for project information) then I would highly recommend this route. Purchase a domain name, create a github page, fork a Jekyll theme over, throw some content up, and you’re done.
