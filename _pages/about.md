**Employment**

I'm currently a Senior Penetration Tester with a consultant firm. I participate in multiple CTF events, belong to several security focused organizations, and attend numerous conferences on the subject. Historically, I've served in various roles in relation to privilege identity and access management. I've built out some of the world’s largest implementations of privileged identity access systems, predominantly in shared access and multi-factor authentications. 

**Education/Certification**

I currently hold a Bachelors in Business Administration - Management of Information Systems from the University of North Carolina - Wilmington. I've obtained my Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP) and CompTIA Security+ certifications. I've managed to also be trained and certified in various vendor software such as CyberArk, RSA, and Splunk.

**Personal**

Outside of work I’m a beginner wood-worker, avid movie buff, traveler, jeeper, gamer, food lover, and bass player.
